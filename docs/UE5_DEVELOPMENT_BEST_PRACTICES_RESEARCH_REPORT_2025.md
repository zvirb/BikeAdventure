### 1.2 Communication Patterns

```cpp
// C++ Base Class Example for Bike Movement
UCLASS(BlueprintType, Blueprintable)
class BIKEADVENTURE_API ABikeMovementComponent : public UActorComponent
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    // Core physics - C++ only
    void TickMovement(float DeltaTime);
    
    // Exposed to Blueprint for game logic
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable, Category = "Bike Movement")
    void HandleIntersectionChoice(bool bChooseLeft);
    
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintImplementableEvent, Category = "Bike Events")
    void OnIntersectionReached(const FIntersectionData& IntersectionData);
    
    // Pure functions for Blueprint queries
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintPure, Category = "Bike State")
    float GetCurrentSpeed() const;
    
protected:
    // Blueprint-modifiable properties
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Movement")
    float MaxSpeed = 800.0f;
    
    UPROPERTY(EditAnywhere, BlueprintReadWrite, Category = "Movement")

- Convert existing textures via Content Browser right-click menu
- Extreme memory savings by loading only necessary texture tiles
- Trade-off: More GPU instructions per texture sample

```cpp
// Virtual Texture Memory Pool Configuration
class BIKEADVENTURE_API UBikeTextureStreamingManager : public UObject
{
    GENERATED_BODY()

public:
    // Configure memory pools based on platform
    UFUNCTION(BlueprintCallable)
    void ConfigureStreamingPools()
    {
        // Console command: r.Streaming.PoolSize
        float PoolSize = GetPlatformMemoryBudget() * 0.3f; // 30% for textures
        
        FString Command = FString::Printf(TEXT("r.Streaming.PoolSize %f"), PoolSize);
        GetWorld()->Exec(GetWorld(), *Command);
    }
    
protected:
    float GetPlatformMemoryBudget();
};
```

### 8.2 Runtime Virtual Texturing (RVT) Optimization

**Best Practices**:
- Use Static Virtual Textures (SVTs) baked from RVT volumes for runtime efficiency
- Start with 5 mip levels as baseline configuration
- Avoid animating objects rendered into RVT for performance
- Balance between VRAM savings and static memory footprint

**Memory Pool Management**:
```cpp
// Console commands for monitoring and optimization
r.VT.DumpPoolUsage              // Analyze texture memory usage
r.Streaming.PoolSize [value]    // Set memory allocation
```
