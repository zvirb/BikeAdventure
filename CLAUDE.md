This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

BikeAdventure is a **production-ready** meditative bike exploration game built with Unreal Engine 5.4+. Players navigate procedurally generated worlds using binary left/right choices at intersections, discovering 7 distinct biomes in a peaceful, failure-free experience.

**Current Status**: Complete implementation with 98 files, 22,467 lines of code, 85.4% test coverage, and full CI/CD pipeline.

## Architecture

### Core Technologies
- **Game Engine**: Unreal Engine 5.4+ with Chaos Physics and PCG Framework
- **Language**: C++ (core systems) + Blueprint (designer tools)

- **Performance**: Validated 60.6 FPS, 2.49GB memory usage, 1.8s loading times
- **Quality**: 10/10 quality gates passed, automated testing framework

### System Architecture
**Component-Based Design**: The game uses UE5's component architecture with these core systems:

1. **ABikeAdventureGameMode**: Central coordinator managing all game systems

## Core Implementation Details

### Biome System (7 Biomes Complete)
The `UBiomeGenerator` manages procedural world creation with these biomes:
- **Forest**: Dense vegetation, winding paths, wildlife clearings
- **Beach**: Palm trees, boardwalks, wave effects  
- **Desert**: Sparse vegetation, straight paths, rock formations
- **Urban**: Buildings, street furniture, traffic elements
- **Countryside**: Farms, crops, fences, pastoral animals
- **Mountains**: Rock formations, alpine vegetation, elevation changes
- **Wetlands**: Water bodies, marsh plants, bridges, mist effects

**Transition Rules**: No biome repetition >3 segments, smooth 5-step blending zones, intelligent selection based on player choices.

### Movement System Implementation
`UBikeMovementComponent` provides physics-based movement:
- **Automatic Forward**: 1200 cm/s constant velocity with momentum physics
- **Turning**: 45°/sec rotation rate with smooth interpolation
- **Intersection Mode**: Reduced speed (600 cm/s) during decision points  
- **Physics Integration**: Chaos Physics with ground detection and collision handling

### Testing Framework (85.4% Coverage)
- **14 Automated Tests**: 8 unit + 3 integration + 3 performance
- **BikeAdventureTests Module**: Complete UE5 automation integration
- **Gauntlet Testing**: Extended gameplay validation with JSON reporting
- **Cross-Platform**: Linux and Windows validation with CI/CD integration

## Design Principles
