# Bike Adventure Game Design Document

## Core Concept
A meditative, exploration-focused bike riding game where players navigate an endless, procedurally generated world using only left/right choices at decision points. The game emphasizes discovery, atmosphere, and the simple joy of cycling through diverse environments.

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Primary Interaction
- **Single Input System**: At every intersection, fork, or branching path, players choose LEFT or RIGHT
- **Automatic Forward Movement**: The bike maintains a steady, comfortable pace between decision points
- **No Failure States**: Every choice leads somewhere interesting - there are no wrong turns, only different discoveries

### Decision Points
- **Intersection Types**:
  - Classic Y-shaped forks in forest paths
  - T-junctions in suburban neighborhoods
  - Roundabouts with multiple exits (simplified to left/right choice)
  - Bridge crossings over rivers or valleys
  - Cave entrances with branching tunnels
  - Beach boardwalk splits
  - Mountain switchback choices

### Discovery System
Each path leads to unique encounters and environments that can include:

**Environmental Discoveries**:
- Hidden waterfalls behind curtains of vines
- Abandoned structures (lighthouses, windmills, train stations)
- Secret gardens with rare flowers
- Ancient ruins or monuments
- Scenic overlooks with breathtaking vistas
- Mysterious fog-shrouded valleys
- Bioluminescent forest groves at night
- Desert oases with palm trees
- Snow-covered mountain peaks
- Underground crystal caverns

**Wildlife Encounters**:
- Deer crossing meadow paths
- Birds that fly alongside your bike
- Butterflies in wildflower fields
- Fish jumping in streams you ride beside
- Fireflies during evening rides
- Wild horses running in distant fields
- Whales breaching if near coastal paths

**Weather & Time Events**:
- Sudden rain showers with rainbow appearances
- Golden hour sunset rides
- Misty morning fog that clears as you ride
- Northern lights in arctic biomes
- Meteor showers during night rides
- Cherry blossoms falling in spring paths

**Human Elements**:
- Other cyclists who wave as they pass
- Small villages with markets or festivals
- Campfires with travelers sharing stories
- Children playing in parks
- Artists painting landscapes
- Musicians performing on street corners

## World Generation

### Biome System
The world seamlessly transitions between different biomes based on your choices:
- **Forest** → leads to mountains or meadows
- **Beach** → leads to cliffs or boardwalks  
- **Desert** → leads to canyons or oases
- **Urban** → leads to parks or industrial areas
- **Countryside** → leads to farms or villages
- **Mountains** → leads to valleys or peaks
- **Wetlands** → leads to rivers or marshes

### Path Personality
Each fork has subtle hints about what lies ahead:
- **Left paths** tend toward: natural, wild, mysterious, challenging terrain
- **Right paths** tend toward: civilized, safe, scenic, gentle terrain
- (This pattern can vary to maintain surprise)

### Distance Between Choices
- Short segments (10-30 seconds): Urban areas, dense forests
- Medium segments (30-60 seconds): Countryside, beaches
- Long segments (1-2 minutes): Desert highways, mountain passes

## Atmospheric Elements

### Visual Style Suggestions
- Soft, painterly art style emphasizing colors and mood over detail
- Dynamic lighting that changes based on time of day
- Particle effects for weather (rain, snow, leaves, petals)
- Depth of field blur for distant vistas
- Optional first-person or third-person perspective

### Audio Design
- Ambient soundscape that changes per biome
- Bike sounds: pedaling rhythm, gear shifts, tire sounds on different surfaces
- Environmental audio: birds, water, wind, city sounds
- Zen-like musical score that adapts to the environment
- Optional "podcast mode" - no music, just natural sounds

## Collection & Progress System

### Journal Mechanics
- **Discovery Log**: Automatically records unique sights and encounters
- **Photo Mode**: Take snapshots at special viewpoints
- **Path Memory**: Shows a branching tree of all routes taken
- **Statistics**: 
  - Total distance traveled
  - Unique discoveries found
  - Favorite biome (based on time spent)
  - Rarest sighting encountered

### Unlockables
- **New bike skins**: Earned by discovering certain landmarks
- **Time of day selection**: Unlock permanent sunset/night modes
- **Weather preferences**: Choose preferred weather after enough rides
- **Secret paths**: Some only appear after finding specific combinations

## Special Features

### Zen Mode
- No UI elements except choice indicators
- No collectibles or progress tracking
- Pure exploration experience
- Endless generation with no repeated segments

### Journey Mode  
- Each session creates a unique "journey" with beginning and end
- After 15-30 minutes, paths begin leading toward a special destination
- Destinations include: lighthouse at sunset, mountain temple, desert star observatory, etc.
- Journey can be saved and shared as a "route code" for others to experience

### Seasonal Events
- Real-world season affects in-game world
- Special discoveries only available during certain times
- Community events where all players' choices affect a shared world map

## Technical Considerations

### Procedural Generation Rules
- Ensure variety: No same biome for more than 3 consecutive choices
- Smooth transitions: Biomes blend naturally (no desert→arctic jumps)
- Memory system: Recent discoveries won't repeat for X choices
- Seed-based: Players can share "route seeds" to experience same paths

### Accessibility Features
- One-button gameplay mode (auto-alternates choices)
- Colorblind-friendly path indicators
- Optional audio cues for different path types
- Adjustable bike speed settings
- Pause anytime between intersections

## Emotional Design Goals
- Create a sense of endless possibility with each choice
- Evoke childhood memories of bike exploration
- Provide moments of unexpected beauty and wonder
- Encourage players to follow curiosity rather than optimization
- Foster a meditative, stress-free experience
- Make every ride feel like a mini-adventure

## Potential Expansion Ideas
- Multiplayer: See ghost riders who chose differently at same intersection
- Seasons: Same paths change dramatically by season
- Time loop: Some paths lead back to previous intersections with changes
- Dream mode: Surreal, impossible geometry and fantastical discoveries
- Historical mode: Ride through different time periods on same paths
